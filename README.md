# UIAutomation
Search engine automation and verify website link locating on Google's top result page

===========================================================================

What were my reasons on choosing the automation tool?

===========================================================================

I have initially wanted to use Browserstack since I have already paid one month subcription of it.
But I have realise that what if the client doesnt have much budget to maintain the application. 
I have settled with the freemium yet open source app which is Selenium IDE and it is easily accessible 
any web browser: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera.
  

===========================================================================

What have I learned from trying out Selenium IDE before proceeding the code as final?
 
===========================================================================

The steps to install is very easy. The difficult part was at glance the Selenium software design.
It was highly confusing until I realised which area to press and then enter the command code.
The Selenium documentation list of commands weren't easy to read either. It is more like a reference
point rather than a step by step tutorial. 
  
What effectively works for me was using the record tool while following the test instruction more than once.
I got used to the application design of the command line and eventually was able to fix my mistakes in coding.
  
It was a fun experience overall.
  
===========================================================================

Which of my skills were utilised to make this solution possible?

===========================================================================

My current work of exploratory testing made me able to do manual testing of the new application effectively. 
There was no coding design in the command list. But in a sense, its understandable in Java programming 
concept design. It took a bit of time until I have clear up my error codes and ended up running perfectly 
and according to the instruction of test solution.
